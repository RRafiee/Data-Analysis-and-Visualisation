Data Analysis and Visualisation
Welcome to Data Analysis and Visualisation. This module is an exciting journey into the field of data analysis & visualisation and its applicability to the research and industrial world. It teaches students to collect, select and model various data originated from publically available sources.
This module is perhaps one the best practical exercises in analysing data in which you will be able to ultimately create effective web-based tools for exploring and explaining your data. In this module, you will be working on the preparation of a large dataset as well as pre-processing, visualising and ultimately exploring your data with various practical data analytics and machine learning techniques.
